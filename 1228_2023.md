🌱  Today is inspiring day. I met a student from American High School in chatting app ‘Hello Talk’. Actually, he is a chinese born in Sichuan province and went to America to study aborad when he grew up. He shared his experience about geting 100 scores in toefl. And I asked him how he learned the English.Then his words inspire me. He told me that when he learned language, he imagined that he was an American kid and thinked about what he can express to people from all over the world/other countries. This is really interesting and inspires me. Next time I will pretend to be a native speaker and just start to learn English because Im a new born baby, the one who is just born to this world. I hope this method can give me much confidence.
