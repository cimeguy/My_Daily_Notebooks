🌱 Today is inspiring day. I met a student in chatting app ‘Hello Talk’ from American High School. Actually, he is a chinese born in Sichuan province and went to America study aborad. He shared his experience about geting 100 scores in toefl. And I asked how he learn the English.Then his words inspire me. He told me that when he learned language, he imagined that he was an American kid and thinked about what he can express to people from all over the world/other countries.
