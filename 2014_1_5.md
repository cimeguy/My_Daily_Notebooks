Today is an fresh day. My friend who had only met me once came to visit me and my school. Actually, his primary target for this visit is my school. Hahaha

I talked about the knowledge and papers about quantum metrology with him. He gave me help with the assistance of GPT-4. He also answered me the definition of symmetry group.

Also, I talked about my head-scratching thesis in my graduate period. Although it wasn't finished. I think its a gift from my past to my present. So I get to complete it to send a gift for my future. I am wandering how the hopeful figure could be. I used to think if I am hopeful to anything happening to me, I will be cheerful. But it may be a mistake. Because when we pursue a cheerful state or a state of blind confidence, we may be stuck in todays' obstacles cause we always want to fight with something but not to look ahead. What we get to do is just moving on without any hesitation, we should believe that we can do it if we move on. For example, we can finish our thesis if we ride bicycles to the lab building. We can get more knowledge if we go to talk with people who may have a beatiful heart. We can get better if we keep away from those we dislike. We could be smarter if we sleep better. But it doesn't mean that we must be worse if we sleep worse. This is not equivalent. Actually, at all times we are honest with ourselves and keep moving on, it would be better. 
Third, I get to be open for asking questions to my future senior.
