Today is an fresh day. My friend who had only met me once came to visit me and my school. Actucally, his primary target for this visit is my school. Hahaha
I talk about the knowledge and papers about quantum metrology with him. He gave me help with the assistance of GPT-4. He also answered me the definition of symmetry group.

Also, I talked about my head-scratching thesis in my graduate period. Although it wasn't finished. I think its a gift from my past to my present. So I get to complete it to send a gift for my future.

Third, I get to be open for asking questions to my future senior.
